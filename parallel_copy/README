A simple threaded file copy and tar utility designed for situations where file
system latency is dominating file copy speeds.

Usage:

find . -iname qestions*.txt | parcp --create | parcp --tar >42.tar

or 

find . -iname qestions*.txt | parcp --create | ssh remote 'parcp --tar >42.tar'

to transfer the tarfile to a remote host.

NOTE that even though parcp writes to stdout, redirection must be to a file
since parcp must be able to call fseek on stdout.
